## Description:
For this project, we decided to create an employee scheduler. With this application, a user will be able to sign up and then log in to view a calender. Within this calender, it will display the user's work schedule. The individuals who are not managers will only be able to see their respective schedules. If a user logs in and has the credentials of a manager, that individual will be able to access another page which will allow them to create a new schedule for an employee or delete an employees schedule.

## User_Story:
I am an owner of a restaurant and I want an application that will allow my employees to sign in and allow them to view their work schedule. 
I want my managers to be able to schedule the other employees.
I also want employees who are not managers to not be able to access the scheduling page.
